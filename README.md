Scantron Scantools Application and Conversion Profile for Multiple Response Questions for the School of Computing's Scantron Form

This file documents how to use the standard School of Computing Multiple Choice Question (50 Question) worksheet to be used for multiple response questions; i.e. "mark all responses that apply", as opposed to the simple "mark one only" multiple choice questions).

This software is installed and usable on the MCQ machine in the Equipment Room in SoC COM2 #02-63.  If using it elsewhere you will need the two files in the root directory of this repository:

* `Z556.SDS` goes in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Scantron\ScanTools Plus\Applications`
* `CS3244.$CP` goes in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Scantron\ScanTools Plus\Profiles`

The latter file may have been renamed on the computer to `556.$CP` or similar.

## Steps for using the application
