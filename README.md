Scantron Scantools Application and Conversion Profile for Multiple Response Questions for the School of Computing's Scantron Form

This file documents how to use the standard School of Computing Multiple Choice Question (50 Question) worksheet to be used for multiple response questions; i.e. "mark all responses that apply", as opposed to the simple "mark one only" multiple choice questions).

This software is installed and usable on the MCQ machine in the Equipment Room in SoC COM2 #02-63.
